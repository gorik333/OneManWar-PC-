# OneManWar PC
My second game. It was completely invented by me.
In it I used the following technologies:
  1. Physics (drag, rigidbody, colliders, triggers, addforce).
  2. Interactions of the character with triggers, such as the zone for entering the store, selection of chests, control of AI bots.
  3. Building a map using TilePallet.
  4. Upgrade your character stats, damage, shields for skillpoints that you get during the level.
  5. Intra-level store where you can buy armor, rounds, shields.
  6. Moving platforms.
  7. Control character by mouse and keyboard.
  8. Switch type of ammo during the game, they are have different penetration
