# OneManWar PC
My second game. It was completely invented by me.
In it I used the following technologies:
  1. Physics (drag, rigidbody, colliders, triggers, addforce).
  2. Interactions of the character with triggers, such as the zone for entering the store, selection of chests, control of AI bots.
  3. Building a map using TilePallet.
  4. Upgrade your character stats, damage, shields for skillpoints that you get during the level.
  5. Intra-level store where you can buy armor, rounds, shields.
  6. Moving platforms.
  7. Control character by mouse and keyboard.
